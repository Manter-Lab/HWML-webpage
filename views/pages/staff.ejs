In 1983 he received his Masters of Arts degree in<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> Zoology/Parasitology from the University of Northern Colorado where he worked on nematodes and cestodes with Gerald D. Schmidt. He completed his Ph.D. at the University of New Mexico where he worked with Don W. Duszynski  and Terry L. Yates. There he studied phylogeny and coevolution of nematode parasites and their ctenomyid (<i><a href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/parasitologyfacpubs/722/">Ctenomys</a></i>) hosts in the south central Neotropics.<br>
                <br>
                After a one year post-doc in New Mexico, working on coccidian parasites of the genus <i>Eimeria</i> he was appointed Curator of Nematology and Assistant Professor in the Department of Nematology, UC Davis. In 1994 he became Director and Curator of the Harold W. Manter Laboratory of Parasitology in the Division of Parasitology in the University of Nebraska State Museum. He also is an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a life member of the American Society of Mammalogists, an adjunct professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Professor of Biological Sciences, the University of Nebaska-Lincoln.</span></p>

He worked at the Hungarian Natural History Museum as a<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> curatorial assistant and in 1996 he started as a graduate student at the University of New Mexico. During his graduate studies he taught various classes (like Intro Biology, Cell Biology, Mammalogy) and he worked as curatorial assistant in the Mammal Division, Museum of Southwestern Biology. In 2008, Gabor moved to Nebraska, first working as a postdoc at the University of Nebraska, and from 2009 as collection manager at the Harold W. Manter Laboratory, University of Nebraska State Museum. Gábor's main research interests are in the interactions between the ecology and evolution of host organisms and their parasites including studies on ecological factors influencing the spatial and temporal distributions of hantaviruses, arboviruses, tapeworms, and other parasitic organisms.</span></p>
